                    This company believes in protecting the privacy of your health information. We may use or disclose your Protected Health Information (PHI) only for very specific reasons.  PHI consists of any individually identifiable health information related to past, present, and/or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual; the provision of health/mental health services; or the payment for the provision of health care to an individual. PHI can be electronic or in any other format. <br/>

                    This notice describes how the company will protect your PHI, how PHI may be used or disclosed, and how you gain access to your PHI. Types of uses and disclosures are listed and explained below. <b>Note: An example is not given for every use or disclosure reason. Please read this notice carefully.

                    When disclosing or using PHI, we will use the least amount of information necessary (“minimum necessary”). If we need to use or release information in a way that is not generally described in this notice, we will contact you for your permission before the proposed use or disclosure.<br/><br/>

                    We create a record of the treatment and services provided to you.

Your service record is our company property. It is accessible to all departments, programs, staff, professionals, contractors, and/or volunteers who assist in providing services to you and who are authorized to enter information into your record, chart, or file. With written authorization from you, this information is accessible to other entities rendering services to you and who are mandated to subscribe to privacy practices. Such entities are considered “covered entities” or “business associates.” Business associates include but are not limited to auditors, attorneys, etc.<br/> <br/>
                    The purpose of the HMIS is to assist people experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness to have better access to those services, achieve self-sufficiency, and obtain housing.

                    <b>Release of Information to Family Patients</b><br/>

                    <b>Psychotherapy Notes</b><br/>
                    We rarely ask for psychotherapy notes or disclose psychotherapy notes to outside parties. Psychotherapy notes are defined as notes recorded (in any medium) by a health care provider who is a mental health professional documenting or analyzing the contents of a conversation during a private counseling session or a group, joint, or family counseling session and that are separated from the rest of the individual’s medical record. We may use and disclose psychotherapy notes as required by law (for example, to prevent a serious threat to health or safety) or to defend ourselves against a lawsuit by you.
                    <br/><br/>

                    <b>Other Uses and Disclosures</b><br/>
                    Other PHI uses and disclosures not identified above will be made only with your authorization. You are permitted to discontinue such permission at any time in writing.

For example, there are situations in which a licensed mental health care professional may determine that disclosing the information could have an adverse effect on you or another person. In such cases we will not disclose the information; however we may be able to disclose some information in our records. If we deny your request to access information, we will give you written reasons for the denial and explain any right to have the denial reviewed.
